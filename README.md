   - Example: "Christopher" → Pronunciation: **kurosutofa** → Katakana: **クロストファ**.

## 🛠 How It Works  

1. **Input Your Name/Word**:  
   - Enter your name or any word written in Latin alphabets.  

2. **Phonetic Adjustment**:  
   - The program processes the input to match Japanese phonetic rules by:  
     - Removing unnecessary double letters (e.g., "ll" → "l").  
     - Adding vowels to standalone consonants (e.g., "d" → "do").  
     - Replacing specific sounds for accurate pronunciation (e.g., "ph" → "f").  

3. **Katakana Transliteration**:  
   - The adjusted pronunciation is converted into **Katakana characters** using a standard transliteration table.  

4. **Output the Result**:  
   - The program displays the original input, the Japanese pronunciation, and the Katakana translation.
